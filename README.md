# Eternal Bypass
An website that is made to try and combat annoying web filters. The website will rotate the IP and give the tool an new domain evrey time it is reported to be blocked. It will also support adding your own tools to the website, and it will keep your tool unblocked. All services are free. No website is online yet, but to keep updated join the discord server here: https://discord.gg/ucg3PW7dJR

# Donations
Donations are accepted, and need to meet a yearly goal in order to stay alive. These are to pay for the domain registrar services.

As of right now, 30/60$ has been funded. It needs to meet the goal before the site can go up, but the site is still in development, and does not need to meet this goal for a while. This 60$ goal allows for ~20 custom tools anyone can put onto the network for free. Evrey additional 25$ after this goal allows for 25 new custom tools, supposedly unlimited. This is due to the pricing of noip. If you want to support me, there is a tier on patreon for that. But please only do this if the project is already funded for that year.
