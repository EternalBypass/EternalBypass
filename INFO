Hello, this is just some info about how this program does and I want to work.
Its all in the main. Different parts must run in different threads, the actual
execution must end in flasks infinite loop. Other services must be in threads.
Each thread must have the following:
Use the log function to give important information. When logging, make sure
it knows that it is your thread that is giving this info. Handle errors if
possible. Try not to print info, the log function writes to a file. Check up
on your thread using the watchdog to checkup on and restart
dead threads.To do so, make sure that the necessary variables are all global, in
not only the watchdog but the graceful death. Then you can add your thread to be monitored.
Upon starting the thread, make sure it doesnt hang the main execution.
When starting your thread, make sure it is running like this:
self.functionName
and not:
self.functionName().
If the thread is absolutely completely necessary to the entire system working, then
never ever let it go fatal in a way that will kill everything else.
